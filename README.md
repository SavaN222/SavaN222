### ‚úè About me
When I was a kid, I got my first Sony 1 console with game 'Crash Bandicoot' since that moment I know I founded a passion for technology. 

Later, in elementary school I **got first touches with programming** when I wrote small scripts for my GTA online server.

When I finished high school and took life more seriously I decided to follow **my passion for programming**.

The most interesting branches of programming for me is a Web Development, so I started to learn **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript**.

**Because of my problem-solving attitude and loving to solve logic problems, I decided to try back-end development, and it was the best decision of my life.**

The first language I learned was PHP in combination with MySQL. To my new knowledge I added previous knowledge of front end technologies and make some projects, of which the best is a [Social Book](https://github.com/SavaN222/SocialBook).

How my knowledge and passion for programming was growing, I decided to learn a general purpose language and my choice was Java.

**With many online resources, Udemy courses and [JetBrains academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/), I have successfully improved my knowledge of:**

* **Java(Java SE and Java EE)**
* **Spring Boot[Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Data]**
* **SQL**
* **Web Services**
* **Algorithms and Data Structures**
* **Design Patterns**

#### üèÜ For now, my best project is [Learn Together](https://github.com/SavaN222/Learn-Together). which I wrote for a programming competition.
